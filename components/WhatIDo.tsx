                        I started to develop at the age of 14, when I learned
                        the basics of Perl to be able to use bots in Ragnarok
                        Online ðŸ˜‚. During graduation I went through several
                        languages â€‹â€‹and frameworks (Assembly, C, C ++, Ruby,
                        Ruby on Rails). Today I dedicate myself to projects
                        aimed to web3.0, working with JavaScript/TypeScript,
                        React, Next and Node.{" "}
